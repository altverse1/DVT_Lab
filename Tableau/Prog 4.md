>[!question] Using the Sample-superstore data source, find out the sales in the cities, which contain the letter “o”.

**Finding Sales in Cities Containing "o":**

- Connect to the "Sample-superstore" data source.
- Drag the "City" and "Sales" fields to the Rows and Columns shelves.
- Create a filter to include only cities where the "City" field contains the letter "o." You can do this by selecting the "City" filter, going to the "Condition" tab, and using the "Contains" operator.
