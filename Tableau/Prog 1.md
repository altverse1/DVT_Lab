>[!question] Using the Sample-superstore data source, create a join between Orders and Returns table

**Joining Tables (Orders and Returns):**

- Open Tableau and connect to the "Sample-superstore" data source.
- Drag the "Orders" table to the canvas. Right Click on it and click on open.
- Drag the "Returns" table to the canvas.
- You should see a join area between the two tables where you can specify the join conditions. Typically, you would join these tables on a common key, such as Order ID.
- Configure the join conditions and type (inner, left, etc.) as per your requirements.
- Click on the sheet tab to start working with your joined data.
